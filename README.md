# Queue-System
The system being developed is a simulation of a client-server interaction, where clients make requests to a service center, and the service center processes these requests in an organized manner. It involves managing a queue system, where clients are added to the queue based on their arrival times, service needs, and priority levels. The system must track each client's behavior, including how long they have been waiting and how long they are willing to wait before leaving without service.

Clients in the system can either be standard clients or VIP clients. VIP clients have special privileges and a higher priority in the queue, ensuring they are served more quickly. Clients can make various types of requests, such as seeking information, returning items, or purchasing products, and each request requires a specific amount of time to process. These requests are managed by a queue, where each request is prioritized based on its type and urgency.

The queue system itself has multiple lines: a general waiting line and a VIP queue. The system must manage the flow of clients, ensuring that those who have been waiting the longest are served first, and that VIP clients are given priority over standard clients. Additionally, each client is served based on their patience level, which dictates how long they are willing to stay in the queue before deciding to leave. The service center also operates under resource constraints, where certain resources (like TVs or coffee) may be limited and affect how the clients are served.

The goal of this system is to simulate an efficient service center that handles a mix of clients and requests in a fair yet prioritized manner, while also ensuring that the simulation reflects realistic waiting times, processing times, and client departures. It also tracks key metrics such as waiting times, service levels, and client satisfaction to assess the overall performance of the system.
